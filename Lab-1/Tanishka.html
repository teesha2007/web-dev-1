    <h1> Tanishka </h1>

    <p>You are the kind of person who finds inspiration in unexpected places—like a quiet park bench on a rainy day or the hidden corners of a used bookstore. You're naturally curious, often diving down research rabbit holes just to satisfy your urge to understand how things work. Whether it's ancient civilizations, quantum physics, or why cats always land on their feet, your mind is always searching for connections and patterns. This makes you a great conversationalist—people are drawn to the way you see the world.</p>

    <h2> My Interests </h2>

    <p>In your daily life, you balance creativity with practicality. You might be someone who works in a structured field like engineering or data analysis, but in your free time, you’re sketching, writing short stories, or playing an instrument. You find that switching between logic and imagination helps you stay grounded while also fueling your motivation. Organization is your secret weapon—even your chaos has a system behind it.

Your friends often say you're the "observer" in the group. You notice details others miss—a change in tone, a subtle gesture, or an unspoken need. You're empathetic but not intrusive, and that balance earns you a lot of trust. You're not loud about your presence, but when you speak, people listen because they know it's going to be thoughtful and real. You’ve learned that silence isn’t empty—it’s full of potential.</p>
